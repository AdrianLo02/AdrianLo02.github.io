		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Originally hailing from Wilmington, Delaware, I am currently a senior at Tufts University in Massachusetts. I am interested in building a career in graphic design, front-end web development or user experience.</p>
		<p>My work ethic has consistently been recognized by others over the years. As a high school junior at Wilmington Friends School in Delaware, I was given the school's Charles W. Bush Award for "demonstrating the schoolâ€™s ideals of character, scholarship, and service." I would later find out that a teacher recommended me for the award after observing that I often did volunteer work "behind the scenes, and without being asked."</p>
		<p>As an Executive Layout Editor of my campus newspaper, <span class="ital">The Tufts Daily</span>, I learned what it takes to lead a team to get a job done well and under the pressure of meeting a strict deadline. I also put my design skills directly to use by producing layouts and templates using Adobe InDesign and Photoshop.</p>
		<p>As an intern at Savant HWP, I successfully contributed to a team by assisting with research and writing pharmaceutical regulatory documents, which was a challenge since I was working a field that was unfamiliar to me at the time. I simultaneously worked at a second internship at the Center for Arts at the Armory near Tufts, where I ran a price analysis on goods and services and implemented changes to existing pricing models and expenditures. The challenge of adapting and contributing to two very different fields was rigorous yet extremely rewarding.</p>
		<p>I have honed my creative and technical skills through experiences like these as well as coursework at Tufts. I love to design in ways that are both creative and functional with an acute attention to detail.</p>
